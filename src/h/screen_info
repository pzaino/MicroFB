 * This file is part of:
 *      MicroFB, a minimal framebuffer library for RISC OS
 *
 * Description:
 *      This project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to manage
 *      the framebuffer on RISC OS using C++11. It abstracts the direct
 *      interaction with the GraphicsV API, offering a higher-level
 *      interface for drawing operations and framebuffer manipulation.
